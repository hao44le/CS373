For each place which we are interested in, there is a graph that shows the average temperature, the fossil fuel usage,  the deforestation area and amount of CO2. If the above claim is correct, the we will see a high positive correlation between the raise of the average temperature and human activities such as fossil fuel and deforestation. We can also aggregate all the places into a single graph, and observe the overall pattern to avoid some randonmess in the data point.

For each patient which we are interest in, there is a graph that shows the amount of Aspirin used by patient vs patient’s chance of getting a cancer.

We can aggregate all the patient’s information into a single graph to observe the overall pattern.
